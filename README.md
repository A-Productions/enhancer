# Editor Enhancer
A collection of extensions to enhance the Unity Editor.

## Features

### Menu Additions

| Menu Item | Key | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Assets/Duplicate | Ctrl+G<br>⌘+G |Duplicate the selected asset. I know we can do this already with the Edit/Duplicate option, but this is more convenient because the Duplicate option is now available in the asset context menu as well. |
| GameObject/Group | Ctrl+D<br>⌘+D |Creates a new GameObject "Group" containing the current selection of GameObjects. The group will take the place of the last top-level GameObject in the selection. |
